Clara Python implementation.
Uses xMsg as a communication transport.

Following are design conventions:
1) service names are composed as -> dpe_host:container:engine
2) names must be unique within entire cloud
3) registration requests are always sync with timeout defined in xMsgConstants.REGISTER_REQUEST_TIMEOUT
4) finding a service request are also sync with timeout defined as xMsgConstants.FIND_REQUEST_TIMEOUT
5) DPE registration database is duplicated in the FE database.

For installation instructions refer to the "hands-on" section of the CLARA documentation at :
