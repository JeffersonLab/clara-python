python orchestrator.py x y
x = is the starting service, i.e. the source of the data
y = is the data path algorithm or SOA application design/composition

examples of y:
s1 s1+s2+s3+s4
s1 s1,s2,s3+&s4 (s4 fires when s1, s2 and s3 generate data and send it to s4).
               In this example s4 plays the role of an event builder.

Note: "&" and ";" must be escaped in command line with "\"
